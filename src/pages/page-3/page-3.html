  <p>All kinds of happy little splashes. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow
    right out of us. You are only limited by your imagination. Mountains are so simple, they're hard.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most
      valuable things in the world. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.</p>
