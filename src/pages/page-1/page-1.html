    That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough
    reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. The light is your friend. Preserve it. All those little
    son of a guns.

    Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. In painting, you have
    unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains.

    It looks so good, I might as well not stop. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking
    about what's happening - you just let it happen. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.
    It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just
    sneaking around and having fun. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue

    You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. You
    can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. It takes dark in order to show light. A thin
    paint will stick to a thick paint.

    I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. A fan
    brush can be your best friend. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.
    Every time you practice, you learn more. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You can create beautiful things - but
    you have to see them in your mind first.

    It's cold, but it's beautiful. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. What the devil. Just let your mind
    wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.
